3. if I am REALLY drunk:
   the thing that pops out of the hat is a really nice classy glass filled with water that is illuminated so it's like it's sparkling with the sound of angels singing ameeeeeeen."
      interaction:
        1. I am a user that is reaching for the glass of water.
      response:
        1. as my hand gets closer, the lighting turns more red, and the cup hides back into the hat.
        2. says "please do not drink the artwork" in the voice of a portal turret.


If not 1:
     when the presence of alcohol is no longer present in sensor: start reset countdown timer.
